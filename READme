Capstone for Bash CMTP training

This was originally done on AVD/putty but there were issues with extracting the files so it was switched over to GitHub.

Tab keys on the original text file were not converted properly, so all tab keys on the Raw Text file were changed to asterisk. 
myscript.sh has further details in the comments.
