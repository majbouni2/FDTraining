If realtime data is not required for the Quants team, I should propose using batch mode framework to speed up the processing time. The way that this works is that sections of code would get uploaded and processed at a time instead of all at once.  

If an entire batch mode set up is looking to be avoided, you can also ingest data in batch by adding a line of code like this in the algorithmic Q process: 

 
batchsize:10000000 
if[ count of data > batchsize; 
created chunks of data 
run the analytic between each chuck e.g. rows 0 - 1000000, then rows 1000001 to 200000 etc]
